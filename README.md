# Sales Performance Dashboard

**Dataset Background**

The dataset is a retail company that is based in the United States of America (USA), which focuses on selling three product categories: technology, furniture, and office supplies.  The Company operations span 4 regions (East, South, West,  North) and 252 cities across the USA. 

**Objective**

To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Company's sales performance over the period from 2014 to 2017. This analysis will focus on identifying key trends in revenue, customer segment, state performace, product performance, and category contribution. By examining both year-over-year changes and overall growth patterns, we hope to gain deeper insights into the factors that have influenced the companyâ€™s performance both positively and negatively throughout this four-year span.

**Tools**
1. Microsoft SQL Server - Data preparation and data analysis
2. Tableau - Visualize and create dashboard

**Findings**
1. Product sales showed a very unbalanced pattern, with more than half of the sales occurring in the last 4 months. This was in stark contrast to the beginning of the month which showed very low product sales volumes. This imbalance can be a problem resulting in inefficiencies in stock and supply chain management, as well as placing huge pressure on the team during peak periods. 
2. This graph shows that product sales are dominated by a single category, office supplies, which contributed more than half of total sales, 60 percent.. This indicates an imbalance and dependency that could potentially lead to future problems of the growth and profit potential of other categories.

**Recommendations**
1. Optimize supply management to ensure optimal stock levels, minimizing stock-outs and maximizing sales opportunities during Q4.
2. Conduct themed campaigns such as twin dates, mid-year sales to attract customers during quiet periods.
3. Create a marketing campaign that focuses on promoting the Furniture and Technology product categories.
4. Offer a bundling offer that contains a combination of products from all three categories at a special price.
5. Offer exclusive rewards or points to customers who purchase in Q1 to encourage off-peak season transactions.
